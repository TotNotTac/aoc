# adventOfCode2021

Welcome to my attempt of the Advent of Code 2021. I will use the programming
language `Haskell`. It is likely that I will only keep up for a couple of days
since I am a full-time student and I don't always have time to make the
challenges. 


## Running

Download the `Nix` package manager: https://nixos.org/download.html

Run `run.sh` in the root of the repo.
